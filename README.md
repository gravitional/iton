在 `诅咒1.0` 十岁生日时，它的末日也快到了。VISTA以后，微软实在难以找到对操作系统频繁升级的理由，
这多少延长了 `诅咒1.0` 的寿命，但操作系统就像暴发户的老婆，升级总是不可避免的，
 `诅咒1.0` 代码的兼容性越来越差，很快就将沉入网络海洋的底部，成为死亡的沙子销声匿迹。
但正在此时，诞生了一门新的学科：IT考古学。
按说网络世界的历史还不到半个世纪，没什么古可考，仍然有很多怀旧的人热衷此道。
IT考古主要是发掘那些仍然活在网络世界某些犄角旮旯的东西，比如十年来都没有点击过但仍能点开的网页，
二十年没有人光顾但仍能注册发帖的BBS等等，这些虚拟古董中，来自“远古”的病毒是IT考古学家们最热衷寻找的，
如果能找到一个十多年前诞生的仍在网上活着的病毒，就有在天池中发现恐龙一般的感觉。

 `诅咒1.0` 被发现了，发现者把病毒的全部代码升级到新的操作系统下，这样就能保证它再存活十年。
这人没有张扬，也许这是为了他（她）所珍爱的这件古董更顺利地存活下去。这就是 `诅咒2.0`。
人们把十年前 `诅咒1.0` 的创造者叫 `诅咒始祖`，把这个IT考古学家叫 `诅咒升级者`。

After VISTA, it was difficult for Microsoft to find a reason to upgrade the OS frequently, which prolonged the life of Curse 1.0.
This more or less extended the life of Curse 1.0, but operating systems are just like the wife of megalomaniacs, and upgrades are always inevitable.
The code of Cursed 1.0 is becoming less and less compatible, and will soon sink to the bottom of the network ocean,
becoming the sand of death and disappearing.
But at this point, a new discipline was born: IT archaeology.
Though the history of the network is less than half a century, there is too little to dig with.
Still, a lot of nostalgic people keen to do this.
IT archaeology is mainly to discover those things that still live in certain nooks and crannies of the online world,
such as the web pages that have not been clicked for ten years but can still be explored.
BBS that no one visited for twenty years, but can still register and post,  and so on.
In these virtual antiques, viruses from the "ancient" are which the IT archaeologists are most eager to find.
If you can find a virus born more than a decade ago, and it still alive on the Internet,
there is a same feeling of finding dinosaurs in a mountain pool.

Curse 1.0 was discovered, and the discoverer upgraded the entire code of the virus to a new operating system,
to guarante that it would survive for another ten years.
This person did not flaunt it, perhaps it was for the smoother survival of this antique that he or she cherished.
This is the Curse 2.0.
People call the creator of Curse 1.0 ten years ago "the curse originator", and this IT archaeologist "the curse upgrader".
